Project Overview
This project aims to enhance the security and integrity of digital certificates by leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts. By implementing a decentralized solution, we can ensure that digital certificates are tamper-proof, easily verifiable, and securely stored.

Key Features
Blockchain-Based Storage: Utilizes Ethereum blockchain for secure storage and management of digital certificates, ensuring immutability and transparency.
Smart Contracts: Automated verification and issuance of certificates through smart contracts, reducing the need for intermediaries and streamlining the process.
Decentralized File Storage: Implements IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for distributed storage of certificate data, enabling efficient access and retrieval.
User-Friendly Interface: A responsive web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a seamless user experience for both certificate issuers and recipients.
Integration with MetaMask: Facilitates secure transactions and interactions with the Ethereum blockchain through the MetaMask wallet, enhancing user security and privacy.
Technologies Used
Ethereum: A decentralized platform for building and deploying smart contracts.
MetaMask: A cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain securely.
IPFS: A peer-to-peer distributed file system for storing and sharing data across a decentralized network.
HTML/CSS: Used for building the front-end interface of the application.
JavaScript: Implements dynamic functionality and interactions within the web application.
